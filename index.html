<h1 style="margin-left: 15%;">Mirador demonstration</h1>
<div class="landing">This site provides a very simple demonstration of two different applications of the IIIF protocol.</div>
<div>The site provides two pages showing a basic instance of the Mirador IIIF viewer showing page image scans of works by Alexander Pope held by the British Library and Harvard University:
<ul>
<li><a href="horace.html">A comparison of an authorised London edition of one of Pope's Horatian imitations alongside an unauthorised Edinburgh edition of the same title.</a></li>
<li><a href="ethic.html">A juxtaposition of the manuscript of Pope's <em>Ethic Epistles</em> held by Harvard University with the text of a copy of the first edition held by the British Library.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Another page demonstrates how the IIIF Image API can be used to select regions of an image on a remote server:
<ul>
<li><a href="remote_image.html">Interactive form for selecting regions from the title page of Volume VI of Pope's translation of the <em>Iliad</em>, held by the British Library.</li>
  </ul>  
</body>
